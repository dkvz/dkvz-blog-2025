# Blog engine dkvz.eu - Revamp 2025 (Nuxt)

# Useful links
- [Icon list](https://icones.js.org/)

# TODO
Just removing the items when done this time around.

- I think I have to change how I color icons if I'm to use the CSS ones 
- Do I need "alt" on icons?
- Added NuxtLoadingIndicator to the layout but no idea if it works or ruins the layout itself
- Does the build process minify CSS?
- We should make dark mode preference work without JS by adding the relevant media query and duplicating a bunch of styles and variables
